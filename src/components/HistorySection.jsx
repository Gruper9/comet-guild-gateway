                Comet was born from the dreams of a small group of dedicated MapleStory players who sought 
                more than just individual achievement. In the early days of our server, a handful of friends 
                realized that the true magic of Maple World wasn't just in reaching the highest levels or 
                acquiring the rarest equipmentâ€”it was in the bonds forged through shared adventures.

                What started as casual dungeon runs and boss fights gradually evolved into something greater. 
                Our founders envisioned a guild that would be more than just a collection of players; they 
                wanted to create a family. Through countless late-night grinding sessions, epic raid battles, 
                and moments of triumph and defeat, Comet transformed from a small group into a thriving community.

                Today, Comet stands as one of the most respected guilds in our server, known not just for 
                our strength in battle, but for our unwavering support of one another. We continue to honor 
                our founding principles: friendship, dedication, and the belief that together, we can 
                overcome any challenge that Maple World throws our way.
